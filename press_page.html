            &emsp;Exhibition Ice Bound is a collection of art and artists that
            use their own style of art to express, symbolize, and work on bringing
            awareness to the rapidly depleting icebergs within the poles. The
            process of what may be causing this decay is also shown in the exhibition
            as well. One of the main concerns Ben, the curator, wanted to cover
            throughout this exhibition is climate change and show the ways humans
            are directly affecting it on both sides.
          </p><p style="max-width: 50vh; font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 1vh;">
            &emsp;Climate change is one of the biggest issues plaguing mankind this
            century. One of the main problems that arise from climate change is
            the changes in weather causing entire ecosystems to crash and burn
            or freeze over. This drastic change in climate is due to the amount
            of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which has been oversupplied
            by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and animal farming
            over the past couple of decades.

            &emsp;Exhibition Ice Boundâ€™s main goal is not to just show off and
            bring light to the bad but also to the good and what we can do if
            we try. This way it can bring hope and encouragement to work on
            trying to keep the beauty of the world intact. The exhibition will
            be open indefinitely until the world or technology ceases to exist
            so that it can shed light on the past and what humanity was doing
            at the time to fuel or to fend off the ever-shrinking polar ice caps.
